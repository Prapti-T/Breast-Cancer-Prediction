## Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction done using four Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, GradientBoost

### About the Dataset
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) --- Input Variable
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) --- Input Variable
- perimeter --- Input Variable
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) --- Input Variable
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) --- Input Variable
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) --- Input Variable
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) --- Input Variable
- symmetry --- Input Variable
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1) --- Input Variable

Note: The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

The output variable that will be predicted is "diagnosis" column:
diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) - Output Variable
